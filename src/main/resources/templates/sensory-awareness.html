        <h5 class="card-title">The Sense Meditation</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
            The sense meditation is a simple yet powerful way to develop deeper awareness and presence within all five of your senses.
            Find a place to sit outside and focus all your attention on being present for at least 5 minutes. Best results come from doing it for 20 minutes or longer.
        <p>
            Start by closing your eyes and taking a few moments to relax. Feel the different parts of your body relaxing. Feel the weight of your body against the ground. Feel your breath floating in and out.
            Listen deeply to all the sounds happening around you. How many different sounds can you hear? What’s the farthest sound you can hear? What’s the quietest sound you can hear?
            Use your nose to smell the environment around you. Feel the sunshine and wind on your face. Really tune in and pay attention.
            Finally open your eyes and gaze softly at the world. Allow your visual field to open up in every direction. Keep your head still but notice the movement of birds, wind, and squirrels in the corner of your eye.
            Just sit in total openness with all your senses engaged for as long as you want. The best results will always come from doing this as a daily routine.
        <p>
            Compare the experience of doing sense meditation in the daytime versus sunset or after dark. Over time you’ll notice the experience changes and becomes richer as your senses become more open.
            You can also add in the other 7 sensory awareness exercises to this core routine as a starting point.
